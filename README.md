# COVID-19

In this homework you will explore and model the development of the **COVID-19 pandemic 2019-2022**. 

The dataset is provided in this repository. 

**Create a quarto document** and write your solutions into that document such that the rendered html-file is **"human-readable"**. That means meaningful headlines, well-prepared graphics, code folded, no clutter of code output, and some short text introducing and concluding the different exercises. 

Find the first exercises below.   

**Watch out:** More exercises will appear here later in new README-files! You will extend your analysis in the same quarto document. 
Finally, you have one html-file with all analyses. 

# Data

1. Daily numbers of new cases of COVID-19 and new COVID-19 related deaths in most countries in the world as collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) on a daily basis. The data is from 2022-09-30.
